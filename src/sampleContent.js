  leadershipBodyHtml: `
<p>Sri Lanka is going through a difficult time with the ongoing storms and flooding affecting many families and communities. As your CEO — but more importantly, as someone who understands how unpredictable life can be — I want you to know that your safety and well-being come before everything else.</p>
<p>Please prioritise your health, your family, your home, and your personal security over work obligations. If you are affected in any way — from transportation challenges to property damage — speak to your supervisor or HR immediately. We are here to support you, not add pressure.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, I continue to be inspired by the resilience, compassion, and unity shown by our Port City BPO family. The way you support each other, step up for clients, and maintain professionalism during uncertainty makes our organisation stand out.</p>
<p>As we enter the festive season, I hope you find moments of peace and celebration amidst the chaos. May this Christmas bring you rest, warmth, and renewed hope for the year ahead.</p>
<p>On behalf of the entire leadership team, thank you for the heart you bring to this company.</p>
